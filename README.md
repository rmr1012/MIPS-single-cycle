# MIPS-single-cycle
Single Cycle Implementation of MIPS


Evaluation: Report the following for xc7z020clg484-1 FPGA
ASM1  
Area: Number of LUT, LUTRAM, and FF  
LUT: 1239  
LUTRAM: 0  
FF: 516  
Time: Minimum clock period supported by the design in ns   
11ns  
Number of clock cycle to execute the above-mentioned assembly codes  
30 Cycles  
Power consumption (should not exceed the safe limit reported by Vivado) in watts  
0.11W  
Cost Function = (percentage usage of LUT + percentage usage of FF) × clock period × number of clock cycle × power = (percentage usage of LUT + percentage usage of FF) × energy The unit of energy should be nJ (nano joule)  
Report the values of the cost function for both the assembly codes.  
(2.33+0.48) + 11 x 30 x 0.11W = 102.003 nJ  

ASM2  
Area: Number of LUT, LUTRAM, and FF  
LUT: 1239  
LUTRAM: 0  
FF: 516  
Time: Minimum clock period supported by the design in ns  
11ns  
Number of clock cycle to execute the above-mentioned assembly codes  
9 Cycles  
Power consumption (should not exceed the safe limit reported by Vivado) in watts  
0.11W  
Cost Function = (percentage usage of LUT + percentage usage of FF) × clock period × number of clock cycle × power = (percentage usage of LUT + percentage usage of FF) × energy The unit of energy should be nJ (nano joule)  
Report the values of the cost function for both the assembly codes.  
(2.33+0.48) + 11 x 9 x 0.11W = 30.6 nJ
